Core-Login Instrument

You've just installed the core-login.instrument into your orchestra application, following installation you need to run:

$  php script/db migrate

Next you need to create a user account, to do so open your application and point the browser to "/user/new_item" from this admin you can create your account. Now that you've created you account, you need to add the authorization method to your ApplicationControllers.

Place this, after your last method in app/controllers/application_controller.php

  public function authorize() {
  	global $helpers;
  	if(!isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {
  		$this->redirect_to('login', array('page' => 'index'));
  	}
  }

Now in any of your controllers you can add:

  $this->authorize();

to require authorization.
