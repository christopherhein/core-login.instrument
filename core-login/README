Core-Login Instrument

You've just installed the core-login.instrument into your orchestra application, following installation you need to run:

  $  php script/db migrate

Next you need to create a user account to do so:

  1) Open app/controllers/users_controller.php
  
  2) Comment out "$this->authorize();"
      Your before_filter method should look like this:
      
      public function before_filter() {
        // $this->authorize();
      }
  
  3) Point your browser to "/user/new_item"
  
  4) Create account.
  
  5) Uncomment "$this-authorize();"
  
  
Place this, after your last method in app/controllers/application_controller.php

  public function authorize() {
  	global $helpers;
  	if(!isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {
  		$this->redirect_to('login', array('page' => 'index'));
  	}
  }

To add a requirement for authorization to any of your pages use this inside the controllers method:

  $this->authorize();
  
Last thing you should do is generate an admin controller:
  
  1) $ php script/generate controller admin index

Enjoy!
