What:
This is an instrument file for creating a login and session generator for your Orchestra Apps.
This adds and authorization method to your application_controller.php, allowing you to turn any page into one that requires a username and password.

Installation:
First you must have already installed the sys_orchestra (https://github.com/christopherhein/system-orchestra-mvc)
If that is installed use:

  $ instrument pull core-login
  
This with build the instrument locally in /usr/local/orchestra/instruments/ once that is complete you can use:

  $ instrument install core-login
  
from the root directory of any Orchestra App and it will install all the necessary files, plus walk you through any additional steps.

Enjoy!
